finite-map
==========

This package is included for compatbility reasons only.
It contains the deprecated library `Data.FiniteMap` implementing
finite maps, i.e., efficient purely functional data structures
to store a mapping from keys to values.
Instead of this library, one should use the library `Data.Map`
from package `containers` (which has a slightly different API).
